🥳Saturday Timetable Prediction Using Candidate Elimination and Find-S Algorithms🥳
This project implements both the Candidate Elimination and Find-S algorithms to predict the schedule for Saturdays based on a given set of attributes. The goal is to determine the most specific and general hypotheses that explain the data, and use them to predict Saturday activities.
✍️Algorithms:
Find-S: Finds the most specific hypothesis that fits all positive examples in the dataset.
Candidate Elimination: Finds both the most general and most specific hypotheses by maintaining a version space throughout the learning process.
